      All jokes aside it ticks two of the 3 checkboxes every JS framework has.
      * [X] it is innovative
      * [X] it is made by a small team that may abandon it at any time
      * [ ] there is something else that already does the same thing and you don't need it. 

      As you can see - it fails to check in just the right places.
